As Boeing\'s first [[fly-by-wire]] airliner, it has computer-mediated controls. It is also the first commercial aircraft to be designed entirely with [[computer-aided design]].        The 777 is produced in two fuselage lengths {{As of|2014|lc=y}}. The original 777-200 variant entered commercial service in 1995, followed by the extended-range 777-200ER in 1997. The stretched 777-300, which is {{convert|33.25|ft|abbr=on|adj=on|sigfig=3}} longer, followed in 1998. The longer-range 777-300ER and 777-200LR variants entered service in 2004 and 2006 respectively, while the 777F, a [[Cargo aircraft|freighter]] version, debuted in February 2009; these variants all feature [[General Electric GE90]] engines and extended [[Wingtip device#raked wingtip|raked wingtips]]. The earlier 777-200, -200ER and -300 versions are equipped with GE90, [[Pratt & Whitney PW4000]], or [[Rolls-Royce Trent 800]] engines. The 777-200LR is the world\'s longest-range airliner, able to fly more than halfway around the globe, and holds the record for the longest distance [[Non-stop flight|flown non-stop]] by a commercial aircraft.<ref name=guinness/><ref name=NYT_772LR_record/>     The 777 first entered commercial service with [[United Airlines]] on June 7, 1995. It has received more orders than any other wide-body airliner; as of December 2015, 60 customers<!--The unidentified customers are grouped as one by Boeing. JAL Domestic and International air counted as one--> had placed orders for 1,885 aircraft of all variants, with 1,361 delivered.<ref name=777_O_D_summ/> The most common and successful variant is the 777-300ER with 614 delivered and 790 orders;<ref name=777_O_D_summ/> [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]] operates the largest 777 fleet, with 144 passenger and freighter aircraft as of July 2015.<ref name=FI15/> The 777 has been involved in five [[hull loss]]es as of October 2015; the [[Asiana Airlines Flight 214]] accident in July 2013 was its first fatal crash in 18 years of service.        The 777 ranks as one of Boeing\'s best-selling models. Airlines have acquired the type as a comparatively [[Fuel efficiency|fuel-efficient]] alternative to other wide-body jets and have increasingly deployed the aircraft on long-haul transoceanic routes. Direct market competitors include the [[Airbus A330|Airbus A330-300]], newly launched [[Airbus A350 XWB]], and the out-of-production [[Airbus A340|A340]] and [[McDonnell Douglas MD-11]]. The [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner|787 Dreamliner]], which entered service in 2011, shares design features with the 777. In November 2013, Boeing announced the development of upgraded 777-8 and 777-9 variants, collectively named [[Boeing 777X|777X]], featuring composite wings and GE9X engines and further technologies developed for the 787.

GE will improve the fan module and the high pressure compressor stage-1 [[blisk]] in the GE-90-115 turbofan, as well as reduce clearances between the tips of the turbine blades and the shroud during cruise.  These improvements, of which the latter is the most important and was derived from work to develop the [[Boeing 787|787]], will, GE says, lower fuel burn by 0.5%.  Boeing\'s wing modification will deliver the remainder. Boeing stated that every 1% improvement in the 777-300ER\'s fuel burn translates into being able to fly the aircraft another 75 nautical miles on the same load of fuel, or add ten passengers or 2,400&nbsp;lb of cargo to a "load limited" flight.<ref>Norris, Guy, "Mind the gap", Aviation Week & Space Technology, February 16 - March 1, 2015, pp. 42-3.</ref>                   In March 2015, additional details of the improvement package were published in Aviation Week & Space Technology.  The 777-300ER will shed 1,800 lb.  Boeing will replace the fuselage crown with tie rods and composite integration panels, similar to those used on the 787. New flight control software will eliminate the need for the tail skid by keeping the tail off the runway surface regardless of the extent to which pilots command the elevators.  Boeing is also redesigning the inboard flap fairings to reduce drag by reducing pressure on the underside of the wing. The outboard raked wingtip will have a divergent trailing edge, a "poor man\'s airfoil" (Boeing\'s description) originally developed for the [[McDonnell Douglas MD-12]] project.  Another change involves elevator trim bias.  These changes would not only increase fuel efficiency, they would allow airlines to add 14 additional seats to the airplane, increasing per seat fuel efficiency by 5%<ref>Norris, Guy, Sharpened edge,

Originally, the span arrangement of the airfoil sections of the 737 wing was planned to be very similar to that of the 707 and 727, although somewhat thicker. However, a substantial improvement in drag at high Mach numbers was achieved by altering these sections near the nacelle.<ref>Olason, M.L. and Norton, D.A.

Boeing fixed the drag issue by introducing new longer nacelle/wing fairings, and improved the airflow over the flaps and slats. The production line also introduced an improvement to the flap system, allowing increased use during takeoff and landing. All these changes gave the aircraft a boost to payload and range, and improved short-field performance.{{sfn|Sharpe|Shaw|2001|p=20|ps=}} In May 1971, after aircraft #135, all improvements, including more powerful engines and a greater fuel capacity, were incorporated into the 737-200, giving it a 15% increase in payload and range over the original -200s.{{sfn|Redding|Yenne|1997|p=183|ps=}} This became known as the 737-200 Advanced, which became the production standard in June 1971.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.boeing.com/assets/pdf/commercial/airports/acaps/737.pdf |title= 737 Airplane Characteristics for Airport Planning |date= May 2011 |publisher= Boeing |accessdate= 7 February 2015}}</ref>  [[File:Boeing 737-200 planform view.jpg|thumb|USAF [[Boeing T-43|T-43]] shortly after takeoff.]] In 1970, Boeing received only 37 orders.

Boeing wanted to increase capacity and range, incorporating improvements to upgrade the aircraft to modern specifications, while also retaining commonality with previous 737 variants. In 1980, preliminary aircraft specifications of the variant, dubbed 737-300, were released at the [[Farnborough Airshow]].{{sfn|Endres|2001|p=126|ps=}}  [[File:Lufthansa-1.jpg|thumb|left|The 737-300 was the first Classic variant]] Boeing engineer Mark Gregoire led a design team, which cooperated with [[CFM International]] to select, modify and deploy a new engine and nacelle that would make the 737-300 into a viable aircraft.  They chose the [[CFM International CFM56|CFM56-3B-1]] [[Bypass ratio|high-bypass]] [[turbofan]] engine to power the aircraft, which yielded significant gains in fuel economy and a reduction in noise, but also posed an engineering challenge, given the low ground clearance of the 737 and the larger diameter of the engine over the original Pratt & Whitney engines. Gregoire\'s team and CFM solved the problem by reducing the size of the fan (which made the engine slightly less efficient than it had been forecast to be), placing the engine ahead of the wing, and by moving engine accessories to the sides of the engine pod, giving the engine a distinctive non-circular "[[hamster|hamster pouch]]"<ref name="hamster">Brady, Chris.

The 737 Classic series featured [[CFM International CFM56|CFM56]] [[turbofan]] engines, which yielded significant gains in fuel economy and a reduction in noise over the [[JT8D]] engines used on the -100 and -200, but also posed an engineering challenge given the low ground clearance of the 737. Boeing and engine supplier [[CFM International|CFMI]] solved the problem by placing the engine ahead of (rather than below) the wing, and by moving engine accessories to the sides (rather than the bottom) of the engine pod, giving the 737 a distinctive non-circular air intake.{{sfn|Endres|2001|p=128|ps=}}  The wing also incorporated a number of changes for improved aerodynamics. The engines\' accessory [[gearbox]] was moved from the 6 o\'clock position under the engine to the 4 o\'clock position (from a front/forward looking aft perspective). This side-mounted gearbox gives the engine a somewhat triangular rounded shape. Because the engine is close to the ground, 737-300s and later models are more prone to engine [[foreign object damage]] (FOD). The improved [[CFM International CFM56|CFM56-7]] turbofan engine on the 737 Next Generation is 7% more fuel-efficient than the previous CFM56-3 in the 737 classics.  The newest 737 variants, the 737 MAX family, are to feature [[CFM International LEAP-X|CFM International LEAP-1B]] engines with a 1.73 m fan diameter.  These engines are expected to be 10-12% more efficient than the CFM56-7B engines on the 737 Next Generation family.<ref>{{cite news |last= Ostrower |first= Jon |url= http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2011/08/30/361428/boeing-designates-737-max-family.html |archiveurl= http://wayback.archive.org/web/20110925210731/http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2011/08/30/361428/boeing-designates-737-max-family.html |archivedate= 2011-09-25 |title= Boeing designates 737 MAX family |date= August 30, 2011 |work=Air Transport Intelligence |accessdate =September 5, 2011}}</ref>  ===Flight systems=== {{multiple image  | align = right  | width =  | image1 = Boeing 737-2V6 Advanced Cockpit Dubai Air Show Ryabtsev.jpg  | width1 = 180  | caption1 = Early 737-200 cockpit  | image2 = S7 Airlines Boeing 737-8ZS flight deck Beltyukov.jpg  | width2 = 180  | caption2 = Modern 737-800 cockpit }}  The [[Aircraft flight control systems|primary flight controls]] are intrinsically safe.

Plans for a business jet version of the 737 are not new. In the late 1980s, Boeing marketed the 77-33 jet, a business jet version of the 737-300.<ref>Endres 2001.</ref> The name was short-lived. After the introduction of the next generation series, Boeing introduced the Boeing Business Jet (BBJ) series. The BBJ1 was similar in dimensions to the 737-700 but had additional features, including stronger wings and landing gear from the 737-800, and had increased range (through the use of extra fuel tanks) over the other 737 models. The first BBJ rolled out on August 11, 1998 and flew for the first time on September 4.<ref name="BBJ">[http://cdn-www.airliners.net/info/stats.main?id=108 "The Boeing 737-700/800 BBJ/BBJ2."] \'\'airliners.net\'\'.

Boeing did so because the company expected [[Supersonic transport|supersonic airliners]] (development of which was announced in the early 1960s) to render the 747 and other subsonic airliners obsolete, while the demand for subsonic cargo aircraft would be robust well into the future.<ref>Orlebar 2002, p. 50.</ref> The 747 was expected to become obsolete after 400 were sold,<ref>Haenggi 2003, pp. 14–15.</ref> but it exceeded critics\' expectations with production passing the 1,000 mark in 1993.<ref name=Sutter_p259>Sutter 2006, p. 259.</ref> By November 2015, 1,519 aircraft had been built, with 20 of the 747-8 variants remaining on order.<ref name=747_O_D_summ>[http://active.boeing.com/commercial/orders/displaystandardreport.cfm?cboCurrentModel=747&optReportType=AllModels&cboAllModel=747&ViewReportF=View+Report "747 Model Orders and Deliveries data."] \'\'The Boeing Company\'\', November 2015.

The 747 is to be replaced by the Boeing Y3 (part of the [[Boeing Yellowstone Project]]) in the future.  ==Development==  ===Background=== In 1963, the [[United States Air Force]] started a series of study projects on a very large strategic transport aircraft. Although the [[C-141 Starlifter]] was being introduced, they believed that a much larger and more capable aircraft was needed, especially the capability to carry outsized cargo that would not fit in any existing aircraft. These studies led to initial requirements for the CX-Heavy Logistics System (CX-HLS) in March 1964 for an aircraft with a load capacity of {{convert|180000|lb|kg|sigfig=3}} and a speed of Mach 0.75 ({{convert|500|mph|km/h|sigfig=3|abbr=on|disp=or}}), and an unrefueled range of {{convert|5000|nmi|km|sigfig=3}} with a payload of {{convert|115000|lb|kg|sigfig=3}}. The payload bay had to be {{convert|17|ft|m|sigfig=3}} wide by {{convert|13.5|ft|m|sigfig=3}} high and {{convert|100|ft|m|sigfig=3}} long with access through doors at the front and rear.<ref name=Norton_C-5>Norton 2003, pp. 5–12.</ref>  Featuring only four engines, the design also required new engine designs with greatly increased power and better fuel economy. On May 18, 1964, airframe proposals arrived from Boeing, [[Douglas Aircraft Company|Douglas]], [[General Dynamics]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] and [[Martin Marietta]]; while engine proposals were submitted by [[GE Aviation|General Electric]], [[Curtiss-Wright]], and [[Pratt & Whitney]]. After a downselect, Boeing, Douglas and Lockheed were given additional study contracts for the airframe, along with General Electric and Pratt & Whitney for the engines.<ref name=Norton_C-5/>  All three of the airframe proposals shared a number of features. As the CX-HLS needed to be able to be loaded from the front, a door had to be included where the cockpit usually was. All of the companies solved this problem by moving the cockpit above the cargo area; Douglas had a small "pod" just forward and above the wing, Lockheed used a long "spine" running the length of the aircraft with the wing spar passing through it, while Boeing blended the two, with a longer pod that ran from just behind the nose to just behind the wing.<ref>[http://oea.larc.nasa.gov/PAIS/Partners/C_5.html "Lockheed C-5 Galaxy, Partners in Freedom."] \'\'NASA\'\', 2000, see images in "Langley Contributions to the C-5".

Versions of the A330 have a [[Range (aircraft)|range]] of {{Convert|5600|to|13430|km|nmi mi|sigfig=3|lk=on}} and can accommodate up to 335 passengers in a [[Travel class|two-class layout]] or carry {{Convert|70|t|lb|sigfig=3}} of cargo.  The A330\'s origin dates to the mid-1970s as one of several conceived derivatives of Airbus\'s first airliner, the [[Airbus A300|A300]].  The A330 was developed in parallel with the four-engine [[Airbus A340|A340]], which shared many common [[airframe]] components but differed in number of engines.  Both airliners incorporated [[fly-by-wire]] flight control technology, first introduced on an Airbus aircraft with the [[Airbus A320 family|A320]], as well as the A320\'s six-display [[glass cockpit]]. In June 1987, after receiving orders from various customers, Airbus launched the A330 and A340. The A330 was Airbus\'s first airliner that offered a choice of three engines: General Electric CF6, Pratt & Whitney PW4000, and Rolls-Royce Trent 700.  The A330-300, the first variant, took its maiden flight in November 1992 and entered passenger service with [[Air Inter]] in January 1994. Responding to dwindling sales, Airbus followed up with the slightly shorter A330-200 variant in 1998. Subsequently developed A330 variants include a dedicated [[Cargo aircraft|freighter]], the A330-200F, and a military [[Aerial refueling|tanker]], the [[Airbus A330 MRTT|A330 MRTT]]. The A330 MRTT formed the basis of the proposed [[EADS/Northrop Grumman KC-45|KC-45]], entered into the US Air Force\'s [[KC-X]] competition in conjunction with [[Northrop Grumman]], where after an initial win, on appeal lost to Boeing\'s tanker.  Since its launch, the A330 has allowed Airbus to expand market share in wide-body airliners.  Competing twinjets include the [[Boeing 767]] and [[Boeing 777|777]], along with the [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner|787]], which entered service in late 2011. The long-range  [[Airbus A350 XWB]] was to succeed both the A330 and A340.

In pursuit of this goal, studies began in the early 1970s into derivatives of the A300.<ref name=Nor_Wagn_p9-18>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|pp=9–18}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Wensveen|2007|p=63}}</ref> Before introducing the A300, Airbus identified nine possible variations named A300B1 through B9.<ref>{{harvnb|Gunston|2009|p=183}}</ref> A tenth variant, the A300B10, was conceived in 1973 and developed into the longer range [[Airbus A310]].<ref name=Nor_Wagn_p18-9/> Airbus then focused its efforts on single-aisle (SA) studies, conceiving of a family of airliners later known as the [[Airbus A320 family]], the first commercial aircraft with digital [[fly-by-wire]] controls. During the SA studies Airbus turned its focus back to the wide-body aircraft market, simultaneously working on both projects.<ref name=Nor_Wagn_p18-9>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|pp=18–19}}</ref>  In the mid-1970s Airbus began development of the A300B9, a larger derivative of the A300, which would eventually become the A330. The B9 was essentially a lengthened A300 with the same wing, coupled with the most powerful [[turbofan engine]]s available. It was targeted at the growing demand for high-capacity, medium-range, transcontinental trunk routes.<ref name=Nor_Wagn_p22-3>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|pp=22–23}}</ref> Offering the same range and payload as the [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]] but with 25 per cent more fuel efficiency,<ref name=Nor_Wagn_p22-3/> the B9 was seen as a viable replacement for the DC-10 and the [[Lockheed L-1011 TriStar]] trijets.<ref>\'\'Flight International\'\' 1981, p. 1155.</ref> It was also considered as a medium-ranged successor to the A300.<ref name="N&W p.23"/>  At the same time, a 200-seat four-engine version, the B11 (which would eventually become the A340) was also under development.<ref name="Eden p.30">{{harnvb|Eden|2008|p=30}}</ref> The B11 was originally planned to take the place of narrow-body [[Boeing 707]]s and [[Douglas DC-8]]s then in commercial use, but would later evolve to target the long-range, wide-body trijet replacement market.<ref name="N&W p.23">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=23}}</ref> To differentiate from the SA series, the B9 and B11 were re-designated as the TA9 and TA11, with TA standing for "twin aisle".<ref name="Eden p.30"/> Development costs were reduced by the two aircraft using the same [[fuselage]] and wing, with projected savings of US$500&nbsp;million.  Another factor was the split preference of those within Airbus and, more importantly, those of prospective customers; twinjets were favoured in North America, quad-jets desired in Asia, and operators had mixed views in Europe.<ref name=Nor_Wagn_p22-3/> Airbus ultimately found that most potential customers favoured four engines due to their exemption from existing twinjet range restrictions and their ability to be ferried with one inactive engine.<ref name=kingsley>Kingsley-Jones 1997, p. 29.</ref> As a result, development plans prioritised the four-engined TA11 ahead of the TA9.<ref name=kingsley/>  === Design effort === The first specifications for the TA9 and TA11, aircraft that could accommodate 410 passengers in a one-class layout, emerged in 1982.<ref name="N&W p.24">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=24.}}</ref> They showed a large underfloor cargo area that could hold five cargo pallets or sixteen [[Unit Load Device|LD3]] cargo containers in the forward, and four pallets or fourteen LD3s in the aft hold—double the capacity of the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar or DC-10, and {{Convert|8.46|m|ft|sigfig=3}} longer than the Airbus A300.<ref name=Nor_Wagn_p24-5>{{harnvb|Norris|Wagner|2001|pp=24–25.}}</ref> By June 1985, the TA9 and TA11 had received more improvements, including the adoption of the A320 [[flight deck]], digital fly-by-wire (FBW) control system, and [[side-stick]] control.<ref name="N&W p.27">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=27.}}</ref> Airbus had developed a common cockpit for their aircraft models to allow quick transition by pilots.

Afterwards, the board chairman, [[Franz Josef Strauß]], released a statement that said, "Airbus Industrie is now in a position to finalise the detailed technical definition of the TA9, which is now officially designated the A330, and the TA11, now called the A340, with potential launch customer airlines, and to discuss with them the terms and conditions for launch commitments". The designations were originally reversed; they were switched so the quad-jet airliner would have a "4" in its name. Airbus hoped for five airlines to sign for both the A330 and A340, and on 12 May sent sale proposals to the most likely candidates, including [[Lufthansa]] and [[Swissair]].<ref name="N&W p.27"/>  === Production and testing === In preparation to produce the A330 and A340, Airbus\'s partners invested heavily in new facilities.

From the moment of formation, Airbus had begun studies into derivatives of the Airbus A300B in support of this long-term goal.{{harvnb|Wensveen|2007|page = 63}} Prior to the service introduction of the first Airbus airliners, engineers within Airbus had identified nine possible variations of the A300 known as A300B1 to B9.{{harvnb|Gunston|2009}} A 10th variation, conceived in 1973, later the first to be constructed, was designated the A300B10.{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=18}} It was a smaller aircraft which would be developed into the long-range [[Airbus A310]]. Airbus then focused its efforts on the single-aisle market, which was dominated by the [[Boeing 737|737]] and [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9]].\n[[File:Airbus A320-100 Air Inter Gilliand.jpg|thumb|[[Air Inter]] A320-100 in 1991, one of the few A320-100s]]\n\nPlans from a number of European aircraft manufacturers called for a successor to the relatively successful [[BAC One-Eleven]], and to replace the [[Boeing 737-200|737–200]] and DC-9. Germany\'s MBB (\'\'[[Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm]]\'\'), [[British Aircraft Corporation]], Sweden\'s [[Saab AB|Saab]] and Spain\'s [[EADS CASA|CASA]] worked on the \'\'EUROPLANE\'\', a 180- to 200-seat aircraft.{{cite web |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1997/1997%20-%202904.html |title=A320 family |accessdate=17 February 2011 |year=1997 |work=Flight International }}{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=38}} It was abandoned after intruding on A310 specifications.{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=41}} [[VFW-Fokker]], [[Dornier Flugzeugwerke|Dornier]] and [[Hawker Siddeley]] worked on a number of 150-seat designs.\n\nAlongside BAe (which at the time was not part of Airbus) were MBB, Fokker-VFW and [[Aérospatiale]]. The design within the JET study that was carried forward was the JET2 (163 passengers), which then became the Airbus S.A1/2/3 series (Single Aisle), before settling on the A320 name for its launch in 1984. Previously, Hawker Siddeley had produced a design called the HS.134 \"Airbus\" in 1965, an evolution of the [[Hawker Siddeley Trident|HS.121]] (formerly DH.121) \'\'Trident\'\',{{cite web| url = http://www.century-of-flight.net/Aviation%20history/coming%20of%20age/Hawker-Siddeley%20Trident.htm| title = Hawker Siddeley Trident|accessdate =7 January 2010| publisher=Century of Flight}} which shared much of the general arrangement of the later JET3 study design. The name \"Airbus\" at the time referred to a [[British European Airways|BEA]] requirement, rather than to the later international programme.\n\n=== Design effort ===\n\n\nA new programme was initiated subsequently, called \'\'Joint European Transport\'\' (JET). This was set up in June 1977,Payne, R. Stuck on the Drawing Board. Tempus, 2004. and was based at the then [[British Aerospace]] (formerly [[Vickers]]) site in [[Weybridge]], [[Surrey]], UK. Although the members were all of Airbus\' partners, they regarded the project as a separate collaboration from Airbus.{{harvnb|Aris|2002|p=119}} This project was considered the forerunner of Airbus A320, encompassing the 130- to 188-seat market, powered by two [[CFM56]]s. It would have a cruise speed of Mach 0.84 (faster than Boeing 737). The programme was later transferred to Airbus, leading up to the creation of the \'\'Single-Aisle\'\' (SA) studies in 1980, led by former leader of JET programme, Derek Brown.{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=43}} The group looked at three different variants, covering the 125- to 180-seat market, called \'\'SA1\'\', \'\'SA2\'\' and \'\'SA3\'\'. Although unaware at the time, the consortium was producing the blueprints for the A319, A320 and A321, respectively.{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=44}} The single-aisle programme created divisions within Airbus about whether to design a shorter-range twinjet than a longer-range quadjet wanted by the West Germans, particularly [[Lufthansa]].{{harvnb|Aris|2002|p=120}} However, works proceeded, and the German carrier would eventually order the twinjet.\n\nIn February 1981, the project was re-designated A320, with efforts focused on the former SA2. During the year, Airbus worked with [[Delta Air Lines]] on a 150-seat aircraft envisioned and required by the airline. The A320 would carry 150 passengers {{Convert|1,860|nmi|km|lk=in}} using fuel from wing fuel tanks only. The Dash 200 had more fuel through the activation of centre fuel tank, increasing fuel capacity from {{Convert|3,429|impgal|L|order=flip}} to {{Convert|5,154|impgal|L|abbr=on|order=flip}},{{harvnb|Eden|2008|p=23}} enabling flights with a distance of {{Convert|2,850|nmi|km|abbr=on}}. The aircraft would measure {{convert|36.04|m|ftin|abbr=on}} and {{convert|39.24|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, respectively. Airbus then had to decide on a cross-section for the A320. It considered a fuselage diameter of \"the Boeing 707 and 727, or do something better\". It eventually settled on a wider diameter, with the internal width at {{convert|3.7|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, compared to {{Convert|3.45|m|ftin|abbr=on}} of the Boeing aircraft. Although heavier, this specification allowed the aircraft to compete more effectively with the 737. The A320 wing went through several stages of design, finally settling on {{Convert|33.91|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. It is long and thin, offering better aerodynamic efficiency because of the higher [[Aspect ratio (wing)|aspect ratio]] than the competition, namely the 737 and MD-80.\n\n[[File:Turkish Airlines Airbus A321 cockpit Karakas.jpg|thumb|left|The cockpit of the A321 is similar to that of the A318, A319 and A320. This layout would be incorporated into the [[Airbus A330|A330]], [[Airbus A340|A340]], [[Airbus A350|A350]] and [[Airbus A380|A380]]. This \"[[commonality]]\" enables pilots to quickly transition among these aircraft.]]\n\nWith the A320, Airbus made a controversial decision. For the first time, digital [[fly-by-wire]] (FBW) [[Aircraft flight control system|flight control system]] would be incorporated into a commercial airliner,{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=45}} although it was previously successfully proven on military fighter aircraft, such as the [[Vought F-8 Crusader]]. Aside from associated reduction in weight and cost, this system would provide [[flight envelope protection]].{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|pp=45–46}} The pilot, in essence, places inputs into the flight control computer, which interprets these actions and moves the [[flight control surface]]s. FBW also allows Airbus to make flying characteristics similar to later models,{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=46}} such as the [[Airbus A330]], [[Airbus A340|A340]], [[Airbus A380|A380]], and the [[Airbus A350|A350]]. It would feature [[side-stick]] control for the first time on a commercial aircraft. [[Bernard Ziegler]], son of the former Airbus CEO, [[Henri Ziegler]], was the initiator of the aircraft\'s revolutionary fly-by-wire flight controls with side-stick cockpit controller and full glass cockpit. He successfully convinced aviation authorities of the concept\'s validity.{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/farnborough-airbuss-fly-by-wire-pioneer-bernard-ziegler-wins-flightglobal-lifetime-achievement-award-373768/|title=FARNBOROUGH: Airbus\'s fly-by-wire pioneer Bernard Ziegler wins Flightglobal Lifetime Achievement Award|work=Flight Daily News|date=11 July 2012|accessdate=9 July 2013}}\n\nDuring the A320 development programme, Airbus considered [[propfan]] technology, backed by [[Lufthansa]].{{harvnb|Aris|2002|p=122}} At the time unproven, it was essentially a fan placed outside the engine [[nacelle]], offering speed of a turbofan at [[turboprop]]s economics; eventually, Airbus stuck with turbofans. Power on the A320 would be supplied by two [[CFM International CFM56|CFM56-5-A1s]] rated at 25,000 lbf (112.5 kN). It was the only available engine at launch until the [[IAE V2500]], offered by [[International Aero Engines]], a group composed of [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]], [[Pratt & Whitney]], [[Japanese Aero Engine Corporation]], [[Fiat]] and [[MTU Aero Engines]] (MTU). The first V2500 variant, the V2500-A1, has a thrust output of {{Convert|25,000|lbf|kN|lk=on}},{{cite web|url=http://www.i-a-e.com/media/facts.pdf |title=V2500 |accessdate=18 February 2011 |work=International Aero Engines |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20110712233832/http://www.i-a-e.com/media/facts.pdf |archivedate=12 July 2011 }} hence the name, and is marginally more efficient than the CFM56, with [[Thrust specific fuel consumption|specific fuel consumption]] at 0.560 lb/(lbf·h), compared to 0.591 lb/(lbf·h) of the CFM56.{{harvnb|Gunston|2009|p=167}}\n\n\n=== Production and testing ===\n[[File:Airbus-Höhenruder.jpg|thumb|The [[horizontal stabilizer]] of the A320 is produced in Spain. Other A320 parts are manufactured at sites throughout Europe and the world.]]\n\nProduction of the A320 was postponed for a number of reasons. From the start, the UK, France and [[West Germany]] wanted the responsibility of final assembly and the associated duties. These disputes were known as \"work-share arguments\",{{harvnb|Aris|2002|p=123}} driven by, apart from money, prestige. The Germans requested an increased work-share of 40%, while the British wanted the major responsibilities to be swapped around to give partners production and [[research and development]] (R&D) experience. In the end, British work-share was increased from that of the two previous Airbuses, while virtually no changes took place for the other three major member-countries. Another contributing factor was launch aid, or subsidies, for the aerospace companies from their respective governments. France was willing to commit, while the Germans were more cautious.{{harvnb|Aris|2002|p=124}} The UK government, on the other hand, was unwilling to provide funding for the tooling requested by [[British Aerospace]] (BAe). Estimated at [[Pound sterling|₤]]250 million, it was postponed for three years until 1 March 1984, when an announcement was made about the deal between government and manufacturer. The agreement dictates that ₤50 million would be paid whether the A320 would fly or not, while the rest would be paid as a levy on each aircraft sold.{{harvnb|Aris|2002|p=126}}\n\nThe programme was launched the following day{{cite web|title=Timeline 40 Years of Innovation |work=Airbus|url=http://www.airbus.com/fileadmin/media_gallery/files/press_centre/presskits_backgrounders/Airbus_40_years_of_innovation_-_timeline_illustrated.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=14 December 2013}} off the back of orders for 96 aircraft from five customers. [[Air France]] was the first customer for the type, having placed an order for 50 aircraft, split evenly between firm and options, between 16 A320-100s and 34 -200s. However, [[British Caledonian]] was the first to place a firm order for seven back in October 1983.{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=48}} [[Cyprus Airways]] became the first to place order for V2500-powered A320s in November 1984.{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=49}} [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]] also selected V2500 when it requested 16 firm orders and 34 options in January 1985, as did [[Inex Adria]]. The most significant order was to come when [[Northwest Airlines]] placed an order for 100 A320s in October 1986, later confirmed at the 1990 Farnborough Airshow, powered by CFM56 engines.{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|pp=49–50}}\n\n[[File:Airbus beluga beladung.jpg|thumb|left|An [[Airbus Beluga]] unloading A320-family aircraft parts at [[Finkenwerder]], northern Germany.|alt=Bulbous aircraft unloading green cylindrical aircraft fuselage through upward-hinging door above nose.]]\n\nThe first Airbus A320 was rolled out on 14 February 1987 amid [[dry ice]] and laser beams as part of a spectacular unveiling ceremony.{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=50}}{{harvnb|Eden|2008|p=22}} A number of high-profile figures were present, including the [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince]] and [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Princess of Wales]].{{harvnb|Reed|1992|p=86}} The [[Maiden flight|first flight]] came on 22 February, during which the aircraft flew for 3 hours 23 minutes.

The design is a \"shrink\" with its origins in the 130- to 140-seat SA1, part of the Single-Aisle studies. The SA1 was shelved as the consortium concentrated on its bigger siblings. After healthy sales of the A320/A321, Airbus re-focused on what was then known as the \'\'A320M-7\'\', meaning A320 \'\'minus seven fuselage frames\'\'.{{harvnb|Eden|2008|p=26}} It would provide direct competition for the [[Boeing 737-300|737–300]]/[[Boeing 737 Next Generation|-700]].

In early 1998, Airbus revealed its considerations of designing a 100-seat aircraft based on the A320. The AE31X project was terminated by September 1998, after which Airbus officially announced an aircraft of its own, the \'\'A318\'\',{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=88}} at that year\'s Farnborough Airshow. The aircraft is the smallest product of Airbus\'s product range, and was developed coincidentally at the same time as the largest commercial aircraft in history, the Airbus A380. First called \'\'A319M5\'\' in as early as March 1995, it was shorter by {{Convert|0.79|m|ftin|adj=on}} ahead of the wing and {{Convert|1.6|m|ftin}} behind.{{harvnb|Gunston|2009|p=222}} These cuts reduced passenger capacity from 124 on the A319 to 107 passengers in a two-class layout.

The 129 order book for the A318 shrunk to 80 largely because of switches to other A320 family members. After 17 months of flight certification, during which 850 hours and 350 flights were accumulated, JAA certification was obtained for the CFM56-powered variant on 23 May 2003.

They compete with the [[Boeing 737|737]], [[Boeing 757|757]], and [[Boeing 717|717]]. Because the four variants share the same flight deck, all have the same pilot [[type rating]]. Today all variants are available as [[Airbus Corporate Jets|corporate jets]]. [[American Airlines]] is the world\'s largest airline operator of the A320 family of aircraft with 331 airframes in service as of April 2015.\n\nTechnically, the name \"A320\" only refers to the original mid-sized aircraft, but it is often informally used to indicate any of the A318/A319/A320/A321 family. All variants are able to be [[ETOPS/LROPS|ETOPS]] (Extended-range Twin-engine Operational Performance Standards) certified for [[ETOPS#ETOPS extensions|180 minutes]] since 2004 ([[European Aviation Safety Agency|EASA]]) and 2006 ([[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]]).[http://www.airbus.com/presscentre/pressreleases/press-release-detail/detail/airbus-a320-family-approved-for-180-minute-etops-by-the-faa/ Airbus A320 Family approved for 180 minute ETOPS by the FAA] Airbus With launch of the new Airbus A320neo project, the previous members of the Airbus A320 family received the \"current engine option\" or \"CEO\" name.\n\n=== A320 ===\n[[File:Airfrance.a320-200.f-glgm.arp.jpg|thumb|[[Air France]] was the launch customer of the Airbus A320]]\n\nThe A320 series has two variants, the \'\'A320-100\'\' and \'\'A320-200\'\'. Only 21 A320-100s were produced; these aircraft, the first to be manufactured, were only delivered to [[Air Inter]] (later acquired by [[Air France]]) and [[British Airways]] (as a result of an order from [[British Caledonian Airways]] made prior to its acquisition by British Airways). Compared to the A320-100, the primary changes on A320-200 are [[Wingtip device#Wingtip fence|wingtip fences]] and increased fuel capacity for increased range. [[Indian Airlines]] used its first 31 A320-200s with double-bogie main [[landing gear]] for airfields with poor runway condition which a single-bogie main gear could not manage. Typical range with 150 passengers for the A320-200 is about 3,300 nmi (6,150 km). It is powered by two [[CFM International|CFMI]] [[CFM International CFM56|CFM56-5s]] or [[IAE V2500]]s with thrust ratings between {{Convert|113|to|120|kN|lbf|sigfig=3|abbr=on}}. The lowest speed an A320 can fly is approximately {{nowrap|207 km/h}}.TV channel: National Geographics. Program: Air Crash Investigation [[List of Mayday episodes#Season 9 (2009)|s9p3]]. ~30 min in.\n\nA total of 4,242 of the A320ceo model have been delivered, with 519 remaining on order as of 31 May 2016. The direct Boeing competitor is the [[737-800]].\n\n=== A321 ===\n[[File:Airbus A321 - myAustrian (1).jpg|thumb|left|An [[Austrian Airlines]] Airbus A321]]\n\nThe Airbus A321 is a stretched first derivative of the standard A320. The variant was launched in 1988, when the A320 began operations. Compared with the A320, the A321\'s major change is the stretched fuselage, which is lengthened by {{Convert|6.94|m|ftin}}; the A321 is the largest of the A320 family. This is achieved by adding a {{Convert|4.27|m|ftin|abbr=on|adj=on}} front plug immediately forward of wing, and a {{Convert|2.67|m|ftin|abbr=on|adj=on}} rear plug.{{harvnb|Gunston|2009|pp=213–214}} To maintain performance, double-slotted flaps were included, in addition to increasing the wing area by {{Convert|4|m2|sqft|abbr=on}}, to {{Convert|128|m2|sqft|abbr=on}}. Other minor modifications were made to accommodate the A321-100\'s {{Convert|9,600|kg|lb|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} increase in maximum takeoff weight to {{Convert|83,000|kg|lb|sigfig=3|abbr=on}}. The maiden flight of the first of two prototypes came on 11 March 1993. The A321-100 entered service in January 1994 with Lufthansa.\n\nThe basic A321-100 features a reduction in range compared to the A320 as extra fuel tankage was not added to the initial design to compensate for the extra weight. Consequently, Airbus launched the heavier and longer range A321-200 development in 1995 which has a full-passenger transcontinental US range. This is achieved through higher thrust engines (V2533-A5 or CFM56-5B3), minor structural strengthening, and an increase in fuel capacity with the installation of one or two optional {{Convert|2,990|L|USgal|adj=on|abbr=on}} tanks in the rear underfloor hold.{{harvnb|Gunston|2009|pp=214–215}} The additional fuel tankage increases the total capacity of this model to {{Convert|30,030|L|USgal|adj=on|abbr=on}}. These modifications also increased the maximum takeoff weight of the A321-200 to {{Convert|93,000|kg|lb|sigfig=3|abbr=on}}. This variant first flew in December 1996, and entered service with [[Monarch Airlines]] in April 1997. Its direct competitors include the [[Boeing 757|757–200]] and the [[Boeing 737|737-900/900ER]].\n\nAirbus announced the development of a longer range version named A321neoLR that will be available in 2019. It is positioned to replace the [[Boeing 757|757–200]] in transatlantic and similar markets where the range and payload of the [[Boeing 737|737–900]] is insufficient to replace the [[Boeing 757|757–200]].{{cite web |url=http://leehamnews.com/2014/10/21/exclusive-airbus-launches-a321neolr-long-range-to-replace-757-200w/ |title=Exclusive: Airbus launches \"A321neoLR\" long range to replace 757-200W |date=n.d. |work=Leeham News and Comment |accessdate=26 December 2014}} The new A321LR will have 206 seats; Business Class will offer 16 seats with 36\" pitch and Economy will offer 190 seats at a 30-inch pitch. Airbus claims the maximum range at full payload of 4,000 nautical miles will exceed the range of Boeing\'s winglet-equipped [[Boeing 757|757–200]] while burning less fuel per passenger. The A321LR will be equipped with three auxiliary fuel tanks including one at centerline.

Also known as the A320M-7, it is {{Convert|3.73|m|ftin}} shorter than the A320; four frames fore of the wing and three frames aft of the wing were removed. The reduced seating reduces the emergency exits to six. With virtually the same fuel capacity as the A320-200, and fewer passengers, the range with 124 passengers in a two-class configuration extends to {{Convert|6,650|km|nmi|abbr=on}}, or {{Convert|6,850|km|nmi|abbr=on}} with the \"Sharklets\". Four propulsion options available on the A319 are the {{Convert|23,040|lbf|kN|adj=on}} V2522-A5 and {{Convert|24,800|lbf|kN|adj=on}} V2527M-A5 from IAE, or the {{Convert|22,000|lbf|kN|adj=on}} CFM56-5B/A and {{Convert|27,000|lbf|kN|adj=on}} CFM56-5B7. Although identical to those of the A320, these engines are derated because of the A319\'s lower MTOW.\n\nThe A319 was developed at the request of [[Steven F. Udvar-Házy|Steven Udvar-Hazy]], the former president and CEO of [[ILFC]] according to \'\'[[The New York Times]]\'\'.{{Cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/10/business/10flyboy.html?pagewanted=2&_r=1 |title=The Real Owner of All Those Planes |accessdate=4 March 2011 |author =Wayne, Leslie |date=10 May 2007 |work=The New York Times |page=2}} The A319\'s launch customer, in fact, was ILFC, which had placed an order for six A319s by 1993. Anticipating further orders by Swissair and Alitalia, Airbus decided to launch the programme on 10 June 1993. Final assembly of the first A319 began on 23 March 1995{{harvnb|Eden|2008|pp=26–27}} and it was first introduced with Lufthansa in July 1996.

The A318 carries up to 132 passengers and has a maximum range of 3,100 nmi (5,700 km; 3,600 mi). The aircraft entered service in July 2003 with Frontier Airlines, and shares a common type rating with all other Airbus A320 family variants, allowing existing A320 family pilots to fly the aircraft without the need for further training. It is the largest commercial aircraft certified by the European Aviation Safety Agency for steep approach operations, allowing flights at airports such as [[London City Airport]]. Relative to other Airbus A320 family variants, the A318 has sold in only small numbers with total orders for only 80 aircraft placed {{asof|2015|10|31|lc=on}}.\n\n=== Freighter ===\nA programme to convert A320 and A321 aircraft into freighters was set up by Airbus Freighter Conversion GmbH. Airframes would be converted by [[EADS EFW]] in [[Dresden]], Germany, and [[Zhukovsky (city)|Zhukovsky]], Russia. The launch customer [[Cerberus Capital Management|AerCap]] signed a firm contract on 16 July 2008 to convert 30 of AerCap\'s passenger A320/A321s into A320/A321P2F (passenger to freighter).
